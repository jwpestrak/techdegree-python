# Phrase Hunter

This application is a one-player, terminal-based game. 
The player's objective is to guess a letter of phrase.
If the player submits a correct guess, then all instances of that letter are revealed.
Otherwise, the player loses a "life;" a player has a finite amount of lives to expend before the game is over.
The player wins the game by submitting a sequence of guesses, without exhausting his/her lives, to reveal the phrase.
